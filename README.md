# ToNoteDo

A basic todolist-note app. Created using kotlin/jetpack compose.
The architecture used for the app was MVVM (Model View ViewModel) and tries to follow these principles.

### Components used
- Kotlin language
- Jetpack Compose
- Dependency injection with Dagger/Hilt
- Navigation compose
- Room database
- Material Desing 3

In principle the app was going to be a shopping/recipe list. But after seeing the result I decided to change everything and create an app that covers basic needs, a category for tasks and another for notes. A basic project to be able to learn a little about architectural components, in addition to being able to create a basic interface.
